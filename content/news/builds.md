Our build infrastructure and repo names have changed!

If you want a build with frontend and backend included, just head to [strichliste/releases](https://github.com/strichliste/strichliste/releases). The front-end and it's builds are available at [strichliste-web-frontend](https://github.com/strichliste/strichliste-web-frontend) and the backend is located at [strichliste-backend](https://github.com/strichliste/strichliste-backend)
