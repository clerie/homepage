Strichliste just got a new, experimental command! You can now import users from a LDAP source. 
See the documentation here at our [Commands.md](https://github.com/strichliste/strichliste-backend/blob/master/docs/Commands.md#import-from-ldap) for more details!

You can also let this run as a cronjob to update the users mailaddress or create new ones as they appear in your LDAP directory.

Feedback is appreciated!
