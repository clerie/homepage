We're proud to announce the new strichliste release v1.61 with a lot of fixes and some new features:

* Charge account by PayPal
* Visual fixes (contrast, colors, ...)
* More input validation
* ! Extracted strichliste config to separate `strichliste.yaml` file !

To use the PayPal-Feature, you have to configure your recipient address in the [strichliste-server](https://github.com/strichliste/strichliste-backend/blob/master/docs/Config.md) `strichliste.yaml`.
To complete a PayPal-transaction it's mandatory to press "return to merchant" at the end of the paypal transaction. We're currently investigating ways to do that automatically. PayPal's own `rm=1` parameter does not seem to work here.
